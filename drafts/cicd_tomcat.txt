5. Save the changes

D. Build the project

==================
1. Add executon permission to the scripts inside the bin folder

=======================================
Plugin needed:  Build Pipeline Plugin

+ button will be available next to main tab i.e. "All" tab where all projects get displayed.

I. Jenkins pipeline for staging and production 
==================================
We already created Jenkins pipeline for staging. Now, we shall repeat the same thing in production. The only difference is, the production job will not be triggered automatically. 
So the "Post-build Actions" of the Jenkins-pipeline-Staging should include "deploy-to-production" project. The dropdown value should be "Build other project (Manual step)"


J. Code-based pipeline
===================
Jenkin code-based pipeline is written in Groovy

1. Plugin needed: Pipeline. Check under manage plugin->installed tab:if this is present.
2. Create a project of tye "pipeline project". Say the name of the project is "Code-based Pipeline"
3. Enter the description of the project and go to the pipeline tab. Definition of the pipeline would be "Pipeline scripts from SCM". Enter the respository URL.
4. Add Jenkinsfile in the root path of the project.
